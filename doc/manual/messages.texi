@cindex Message, Selector, Receiver
Often interpreted OOPL, like Syx, use @strong{messages} as @dfn{a way to call a method}.
A message contains a @strong{selector} and a @strong{receiver}:

@itemize @bullet
@item
The ``selector'' is @dfn{a @var{Symbol} containing the method message pattern}.
@item
The ``receiver'' is @dfn{the @var{Object} on which the method will be called, or the @var{Object} receiving the message}.
@end itemize

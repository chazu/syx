= Create a binary package =

== Introduction ==

The behavior of Scons with Syx is not the expected behavior you would have using GNU Make or other packages. You will see *prefix* option will have a different behavior here, so take care of this document and read it deeply.

== Compilation ==

The first step, is to configure Syx and compile it. If you want Syx to be configured in /usr then append *prefix=/usr*:
{{{
@/syx $ scons prefix=/usr
}}}

== Create a binary distribution ==

After a successful compilation, now it's time to create the binary distribution:
{{{
@/syx $ scons bdist
}}}
This will create a directory named *syx-_version_* under the source directory containing binaries ready to be distributed.

== Cleaning up ==

The *scons bdist* command didn't install any file in *prefix* so the only thing you would clean is your copy of Syx.

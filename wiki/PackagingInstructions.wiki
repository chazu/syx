= Create a binary package =

== Introduction ==

You need to have *root privileges* before trying to create a binary package.
This because the binary package contains an image created from scratch, therefore Syx must be installed on your system to create the image.

== Compilation ==

The first step, is to configure Syx and compile it. If you want Syx to be configured in /usr then append *prefix=/usr*:
{{{
@/src/syx $ scons prefix=/usr
}}}

== Create a binary distribution ==
After a successful compilation, now it's time to create the binary distribution:
{{{
@/src/syx # scons bdist
}}}
This will create a directory named *syx-_version_* under the source directory containing binaries ready to be distributed.

== Cleaning the system ==

The *scons bdist* command installed needed files in your system to let Syx be able to create the image. If you want, you can clean everything with the following command
{{{
# scons install -c
}}}

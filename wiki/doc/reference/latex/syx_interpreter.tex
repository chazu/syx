The stack pointer points to arguments, temporaries and the method local stack.

When a context is needed from the Smalltalk-side (e.g. thisContext, Processor activeProcess context, context parent), a MethodContext or BlockContext is created on the fly, or returned the existing one. Working on the context instance will affect Process stack.

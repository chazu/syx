*SEE BELOW FOR SOURCES INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS*

*SOME PACKAGES/ARCHIVES ARE NOT UPDATED YET TO VERSION 0.1.7*

= Windows XP =

To install Syx on your Windows XP system, you must [http://code.google.com/p/syx/downloads/detail?name=Syx-0.1.7.exe&can=2&q= download the installer here].

Alternatively, if you are on a limited system, you can still [http://code.google.com/p/syx/downloads/detail?name=syx-0.1.7-bin-win32.zip&can=2&q= download the binaries archive here].
Extract the archive then Syx is ready to be used. File types are not updated though to match .st and .sim files.

Once you downloaded it, double click on it and then follow the instructions.

= Windows CE (PocketPC and Smartphone) =

To install Syx on your handled system you must [http://code.google.com/p/syx/downloads/detail?name=syx-0.1.7-bin-wince.zip&can=2&q= download the binary archive here].

Extract the archive; a new directory will be created named *syx-0.1.7-bin-wince*. Upload the contents of the directory (not the directory) into the root of your device.

To run it just click on the *syx* application in your handled device.

= Foresight Linux =

To install Syx on your linux distribution perform the following command in a root shell prompt:
{{{
# conary update syx
}}}

This will install the *syx* package or update it if already installed.

= Arch Linux =

To install Syx on your linux distribution perform the following command in a root shell prompt:
{{{
# pacman -U syx
}}}

This will install the *syx* package or update it if already installed.

= Gentoo Linux =

There's no Gentoo official ebuild at the moment, but you may use Layman to install it from the Gentoo Sunrise User Overlay.
If you don't have layman yet, you can emerge it with the following commands:
{{{
emerge -va layman
echo "source /usr/portage/local/layman/make.conf" >> /etc/make.conf
layman -f -a sunrise
}}}

Once this is done without troubles, we can go ahead installing Syx:
{{{
emerge syx
}}}

To upgrade to a newer version of Syx:
{{{
layman -s sunrise
emerge syx
}}}

= Other binary packages =

_*Syx works on many other platforms, but below you'll see only available downloads from this website.*_

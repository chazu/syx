= Getting Syx =

There currently no Syx releases, but you can find the current source in the [http://code.google.com/p/syx/source Subversion repository]:

{{{
svn checkout http://syx.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ syx
}}}

= Compiling Syx =

After you got the sources, type the following command in the syx directory 

{{{
scons
}}}

*NB:* _if the readline plugin didn't compile, try running the following command_:

{{{
scons --config=force
}}}

*If you get any error or warning, please refer everything to me*

To clean objects and everything in the build directory:

{{{
scons -c
}}}

= Testing it =

After the build process is done, you can run tests to check if syx works correctly on your system:

{{{
scons test
}}}

*If get errors from any of the test, contact me*

To clean test objects and .passed files:

{{{
scons test -c
}}}

= Installing =

Syx will install the executable in `bindir`, the library in `libdir` and the data (the image, Smalltalk code, plugins) in `datadir`:

{{{
scons install
}}}

On Windows, it will install everything in C:\Syx by default. Do `scons -h` for a complete list of options.

*NB:* _on Linux, you should update the libraries with `ldconfig`

= Uninstalling =

I hope you won't ;)

{{{
scons install -c
}}}

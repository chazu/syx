=== Released Syx 0.1.1 version ===

This second version of Syx includes as many bug fixes as feature enhancements.
I wanted to release this version just after 3 days because i think these changes are very important.
  * Implemented linear hash tables, similiar to double hash
  * Added method caching to unary and binary messages too
  * Added bdist command to create a binary distribution
  * Improved exception handling and tracebacks
  * Added Integer class with basic bit-wise operations
  * Inline whileFalse: block
  * Covered most of PositionableStream standard
  * Added basic subclassing at runtime

See the [http://syx.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ChangeLog ChangeLog] for a complete list of things that changed.

#summary Access the source versioning control of Smalltalk YX

= Why? =

The VCS of Syx is now Git. Google SVN gave us a lot of troubles with SSL when committing changes. The project is hosted at http://repo.or.cz.

Please read the [http://git.or.cz/ crash courses] for more details.

= Command-Line Access =

If you plan to make changes, please [http://repo.or.cz/m/reguser.cgi register here] then [mailto:lethalman88@gmail.com contact the administrator] to gain push access. Use this command to clone the code as yourself using SSH:

{{{
# Project members authenticate over SSH to allow committing changes.
git clone git+ssh://repo.or.cz/srv/git/syx.git
}}}

Use this command to anonymously clone the latest project source code:

{{{
# Non-members may clone a working copy anonymously over HTTP.
git clone http://repo.or.cz/r/syx.git

# Or over GIT
git clone git://repo.or.cz/syx.git
}}}

= Web Access =

You can see the tree, branches, tags and download a tarball snapshot of Syx at http://repo.or.cz/w/syx.git.

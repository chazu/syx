#summary Access the source versioning control of Smalltalk YX

= Why? =

The VCS of Syx is now Git. Google SVN gave us a lot of troubles with SSL when committing changes. The project is now hosted at http://git.berlios.de.

Please read the [http://git.or.cz/ crash courses] for more details.

= Command-Line Access =

If you plan to make changes, please [http://developer.berlios.de register here] then [mailto:lethalman88@gmail.com contact the administrator] to gain push access. Use this command to clone the code as yourself using SSH:

{{{
# Project members authenticate over SSH to allow committing changes.
git clone ssh://developername@git.berlios.de/gitroot/syx
}}}

Use this command to anonymously clone the latest project source code:

{{{
# Non-members may clone a working copy anonymously over GIT.
git clone git://git.berlios.de/syx
}}}

= Web Access =

You can see the tree, branches, tags and download a tarball snapshot of Syx at https://git.berlios.de/cgi-bin/gitweb.cgi?p=syx;a=summary

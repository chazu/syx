== Why doesn't Scons install files under $prefix? ==

If you are creating a binary package for Syx, the behavior is not the same as other software using mainstream building tools such as GNU Make.
I would invite you to follow the [PackagingInstructions Syx packaging instructions].

Instead if you are not going to create such package, [mailto:lethalman88@gmail.com please contact me] or subscribe to the [http://groups.google.com/group/syx-discuss discussion mailing list]

== Why use #printNl instead of Transcript? ==

The Transcript is always available, but since Syx has been modeled to be *also* a scripting programming language, using the #printNl method is more readable and eye-candy for scripts.

Tough Object>>#print is a faster way to write `Transcript show: anObject` and Object>>#printNl to write `Transcript showCr: anObject`.

== Is Syx available only on 64-bit platforms? ==

*No, it's very portable and runs on many platforms including 32-bit platforms*. You see mostly 64-bit packages in the homepage and downloads because me and other contributors work on 64-bit system so we can create only 64-bit binary packages.

This doesn't mean you can't get Syx sources, compile it for your platform and run it successfully.

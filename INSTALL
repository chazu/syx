Installation Instructions
*************************

Basic Installation
==================

These are generic installation instructions.

   First you need the Scons building system. You can obtain it at
   http://www.scons.org.
   
The simplest way to compile this package is:

  1. `cd' to the directory containing the package's source code and type
     `scons'

  2. Optionally, type `scons test' to run any self-tests that come with
     the package.

  4. Type `scons install' to install the programs and any data files and
     documentation.

  5. You can remove the program binaries and object files from the
     source code directory by typing `scons -c clean'.  To also remove the
     files that `scons test' created, type `scons test -c'.

Compilers and Options
=====================

Some systems require unusual options for compilation or linking that the
`scons' script does not know about.  Run `scons -h' for
details on some of the pertinent environment variables, and
`scons -H' for options related to the builder.

Installation Names
==================

By default, `scons install' installs the package's commands under
`/usr/local/bin', include files under `/usr/local/include', etc.  You
can specify an installation prefix other than `/usr/local' by giving
`scons' the option `prefix=PREFIX'.

   You can specify separate installation prefixes for
architecture-specific files and architecture-independent files.  If you
pass the option `exec_prefix=PREFIX' to `scons', the package uses
PREFIX as the prefix for installing programs and libraries.
Documentation and other data files still use the regular prefix.

   In addition, if you use an unusual directory layout you can give
options like `bindir=DIR' to specify different values for particular
kinds of files.  Run `scons -h' for a list of the directories
you can set and what kinds of files go in them.

Optional Features
=================

Some packages pay attention to `FEATURE=value' options to
`scons', where FEATURE indicates an optional part of the package.
Type `scons -h' for a more a list of possible features to enable/disable.

`scons' also accepts some other, not widely useful, options.  Run
`scons -H' for more details.

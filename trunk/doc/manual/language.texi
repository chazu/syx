@cindex Comments

Before starting reading, you must know that Smalltalk won't execute code enclosed by double quotes. @dfn{All the characters enclosed by double quotes} are called @strong{comments}.

So please, if you are coming from any other programming language that uses double quotes @kbd{"} to create a string object, in Smalltalk it will be threated as a comment.
Literal strings can be created only using sinle quotes @kbd{'}:

@example
> 'this is a string' "this is a comment"!
'this is a string'
> 'this contains a " double quote'!
'this contains a " double quote'
> "this a comment with ' single quote"!
nil
@end example

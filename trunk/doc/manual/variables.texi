@cindex Variable
A @strong{variable} is a @dfn{place where to store values that can change, identified by a symbol}.
In Smalltalk all variables must be declared before they are used. There are several ways to define a variable and its usage depends on what you need:

@itemize @bullet
@item
Instance variables are defined in classes, and they are accessible only by the relative instance, @xref{Objects}. Instance variables exist until the object is alive (referenced by another object), @xref{Garbage collector}.
@item
Temporary variables are defined
@end itemize

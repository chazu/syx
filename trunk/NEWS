        Released Syx 0.1.5 version.

        This version includes yet more features, compatibility with other build systems on different
        platforms, important bug fixes and a great performance boost, which will be continued
        in next releases.
        A list of the major changes:
        - MSVC support has been improved
        - ANSI C and strict ISO compilation
        - External declarations for C++
        - The ST runtime compiler has been replaced with a C-side compiler
        - Class creation issues from ST has been fixed
        - Tracebacks and error reporting have been improved

        - Support for the GNU building system has been added as an alternative to SCons
        - Build under MSYS has been fixed
        - Block ensuring has been fixed
        - New examples have been added such as web code browser and a simple GTK+ application
        - Dictionary rehashing has been fixed
        - A better implentation of OrderedCollection has been enhanced
        - Internal profiling and gprof support at compile-time
        - Created one stack per process against one stack per context

        This version breaks the API for creating new processes and contexts from C and ST too.

--------------

	Released Syx 0.1.4 version.

	A more stable VM has been reached with this version. Many features have been added for both
	the embedding and the environment. This version also includes the "image endianness compatibility"
	target of the 0.2 roadmap and a lot of wrapper methods for GTK+ with a basic GtkWorkspace.
	This is the list of the major changes:
	- Running blocking processes inside the scheduler has been fixed
	- Major fixes to the garbage collector, object finalization, number parsing and to the scheduler
	- Rehashing support for hashed collections such as Dictinoary, Set and Bag
	- #perform: and #copyReplace family ANSI methods have been added
	- Interval and StdIOStream classes have been added
	- Missing lexer rules for quoted symbols and double quotes in strings have been added
	- ZeroDivide exception check for number division
	- Comparing methods to String have been added
	- A bunch of improvements for the SyxGtk plugin
	- Rehash dictionaries from C
	- Visual Studio compilation and debugging support
	- Useful functions for embedding Syx have been added
	- Reorganized inline functions to support other compilers and use dllexport and dllimport when
	  building the library on Windows
	- Inheritance for method and block objects has been fixed
	- rootdir and plugindir Scons options have been added
	- Install dependent-machine object files into libdir instead of sharedir
	- Option -c has been added to syx to continue the startup sequence once filed in files
	  from the command line
	- Support for big endian machines has been completed
	- System signal handling has been added
	- Print a bug report to the stdout on SIGSEGV or SIGILL containing informations on the memory state,
	  the execution state and the traceback of the active broken Process
	- Image recovery on SIGSEGV and SIGILL or through the syx --recovery option
	- Scripting header (e.g. #!/usr/bin/env syx) support on fileIn
	- argumentCount check for methods and blocks has been introduced
	- Documentation installation and uninstallation is now supported
	- Support for 'a' and 'w+' mode with O_CREAT flag have been added to FileStream
	- Several issues have been fixed for packaging binary distributions of Syx using Scons
	- Getopt dependency has been removed
	- Desktop files for Posix systems have been added
	
	Syx changed its logo since previous version. The Windows installer will handle .st and .sim files.
	Roadmap for 0.5 version includes both internal and OS-level threads based schedulers,
	with possibly parallel computing support.
	
	Thanks for all critiques and suggestions, and a special thank to everyone who's contributing to Syx.

30 July 2007
------------

	Released Syx 0.1.3 version.

	This release adds yet more support for other platforms (Windows CE), a bunch of bug fixes,
	and many features like the ST compiler. This is a list of what changed
	since previous release:
	- Fractions, division methods and some other match functions
	  (floor, ceiling, quo, trunc, ...) have been added
	- Some lexer issues (quotes, minus, ...) have been fixed
	- Fixed garbage collection while finalizing objects
	- Many ANSI methods for Character have been covered
	- First attempt to reach endianness image compatibility
	- String to Number methods and viceversa have been added
	- Super messages have been fixed
	- Syntax shortucts such as Object>>#caseOf:otherwise: have been added
	- Fixed cascading parsing
	- A complete Smalltalk compiler has been added
	- Support for cross-compiling and with more options have been added to Scons
	- Save text of methods
	- Increased initial memory size from 20000 objects to 100000 objects
	- More C functions have been documented
	- An important issue in ArrayedCollection>>#replace:From:To:With: primitive has been fixed
	- Access mode (read, write, read and write) to Streams and more methods
	  to FileStreams have been added
	- CompiledMethod and CompiledBlock inheritance has been reorganized
	- Run Smalltalk scripts from command line
	- New plugin to wrap native Win API to create a simple WinWorkspace
	- Build Syx for Windows CE with WinWorkspace running on the device
	- Support for user-defined startup sequence has been added
	- Support for wide-character strings has been added
	- getopt, errno, fstat, access, getenv and perror are now optional functions

	Cross-compiling to Windows CE has been done with host=arm-wince-mingw32ce using CeGCC
	by disabling all configuration options.
	Endianness compatibility is not perfectly reached yet.

13 July 2007
------------

	Released Syx 0.1.2 version.

	This version has a bunch of new features added to the Smalltalk environment,
	and a more stable VM. Major enhancements includes:
	- New compiler flags to build Syx on Mac OS
	- Added Sets and Bags
	- Refactored objects to hold both instance variables and indexed variables
	- Literals in methods are now constant
	- Added basic WriteStream
	- Doubled initial memory size to hold 20000 objects
	- Fixed ByteArray/String small integer to character conversion
	- Added object finalization by fixing GC transactions
	- Added support for infinite-precision numbers using GMP
	- Integer overflow checks when doing sum, difference, multiplication and bit-shift

	Note that Syx can be compiled also without GMP. Eventough you use an image containing
	LargeIntegers, Syx will run without problems but won't understand that numbers.

05 July 2007
------------

	Released Syx 0.1.1 version.

	This second version of Syx includes as many bug fixes as feature enhancements.
	I wanted to release this version just after 3 days because i think these
	changes are very important.
	- Implemented linear hash tables, similiar to double hash
	- Added method caching to unary and binary messages too
	- Added bdist command to create a binary distribution
	- Improved exception handling and tracebacks
	- Added Integer class with basic bit-wise operations
	- Inline whileFalse: block
	- Covered most of PositionableStream standard
	- Added basic subclassing at runtime

	- Covered a limited number of Smalltalk-80 standards.
	- Image compatible with both 32-bit and 64-bit platforms.

	- Interactive console from whithin Smalltalk itself
	- Immediate SmallIntegers and Characters
	- A basic plugin system
	- Support for Floats and LargeIntegers
	- Fixed operations between different numbers
	- Easy C to Smalltalk interaction
	- Added class variables
	- Variable bindings for globals and class variables
	- Added OrderedCollection
	- Very simple method caching
	- Still limited exceptions and tracebacks
	- Remove Glib dependency
	- Syncronous I/O multi-plexing trough Semaphores
	- Use direct pointers instead of indexes for oops
	- Organized better debugging informations
	- Documented using Doxygen
	- Reorganized Syx initialization

28 May 2007
-----------

	After i defined how the VM should become in the time,
	i created a google code account at: http://code.google.com/p/syx.
	Now Syx is officially opened to Internet as an open source project under MIT license.
	I hope to release the first 0.1 version very soon.

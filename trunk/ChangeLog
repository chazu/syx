	* syx-object.c (syx_metaclass_new, syx_class_new): avoid nil values to speed up lookups
	* syx-object.c (syx_symbol_new): put the symbol itself instead of SYX_TRUE
	* syx-enums.h (SyxTokenType): put string-based token types at the end so that syx_token_free can free strings
	* syx-lexer.h: Added SyxToken structure to get rid of GValue
	* syx-lexer.c: removed GValue dependency and Glib ascii functions usage
	Renamed all static functions
	All parts of Syx have been updated with the new behavior of the lexer, including the parser and the tests
	* syx-lexer.c (syx_lexer_free): added function
	* syx-lexer.c (syx_token_free): added function
	* syx-bytecode.c (syx_bytecode_free): added function
	* syx-parser.c (syx_parser_free): added function
	Renamed all static functions.
	* syx-utils.c: completely refactored without using Glib
	* syx-utils.h: removed G_VALUE_STRCMP
	* Replaced all g_strcasecmp and g_strdup with strcmp and strdup
	* syx-init.c (syx_init): removed g_type_init, we do not need GObject for GValue anymore
	* st/kernel/initialDecl.st: fixed instance variables according to syx-enums.h
	* syx-memory.c (syx_freev): new function to free NULL terminated arrays
	* syx-memory.c (_syx_memory): moved from static to dynamic
	* syx-memory.c (syx_memory_free): removed because of future garbage collector
	* syx-memory.h (SyxMemoryLink): removed with syx_memory_free
	* syx-types.h (syx_small_integer_new, syx_character_new): be sure we work on a long before doing bitwise operations
	* syx-types.h (syx_char): added type
	* syx-types.h (syx_size): changed from unsigned long to long according to standard size_t
	Removed lots of Glib memory related dependencies.
	Recovered a bunch of memory leaks

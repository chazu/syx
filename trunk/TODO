Major:
- Parse arguments/temporaries differently than the previous release. Now the scope must be united in 1 method context, for speed matters
- Implement coalesced hash tables with consistent hash functions

Minor:
- Allocate commonly used classes, such as syx_array_class, syx_dictionary_class, etc., in the memory
- Add --enable-debug and --enable-optimization

Documentation:
- Undocument symbols beginning with _ and static variables/functions
